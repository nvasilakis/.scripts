			NAME
			    remindmeto - Reminds user of anything if they are on-screen.
			
			SYNOPSIS
			    remindmeto <dosomething> at <time>
			
			DESCRIPTION
			    Remindmeto feeds users with small bursts of text at
			    pre-specified to remind them what they need to remember at
			    this point in time. All entries are mandatory, otherwise this
			    help is printed.
			
			    <dosomething> : arbitrary text (optionally containing "at")
			
			    <time> : Can be a combination of the following formats:
			      * Time: one- or two-digit number (0-23) to indicate the start of an
			        hour on a 24-hour clock (e.g., 13 is 13:00 or 1:00pm).
			      * Date: keywards (e.g., today, tomorrow), day of week 
			        (e.g., Monday) or fully qualified date (e.g., November 9, 2010).
			      * Increment: period relative to now, using "+" followed by a number
			        and one of {minutes, hours, days, months, years}.
