==Scripts==

This is a bash (mainly) scripts library -- a scriptorium!

The scripts are mostly targeted to give solutions to specific issues and automate minor processes in order to have a good size-to-usability ratio.

===Current status===

The scripts currently added:

 * populate: installs the .rc files and numerous vim plugins.
 * doc: converts javadoc to .pdf, removing menues etc.
 * cold-start: installs main programs and dependencies in debian linux.
 * < >: creates an svn server project and integrates it with trac.
