==Scripts==

This is a bash (mainly) scripts library -- a scriptorium!

The scripts are mostly targeted to give solutions to specific issues and
automate minor processes in order to have a good size-to-usability
ratio. Many scripts can be combined for added functionality!

===Current status===

The bash scripts currently added:

  * bk.sh :                 repository backups aid
  * cheatview.sh :          blazingly fast refcard view at your fingertips
  * continuity.sh :         automatically create svn repos with the use of trac
  * doc.sh :                clean and bundle javadoc in pdf format
  * generateTests.sh :      test generation for 100% path coverage
  * lock_keys.sh :          show on/off notification on caps/num/etc lock
  * mujava.sh :             automate mutation analysis
  * multizip.sh :           archive multiple directories

  * print.sh :              distribute documents among printers with page/hour limits

The python scripts currently added:

  * skype-notify.py :        hendle the rest of the messages

Minor note: using functions from "sourced" bash files while on zsh
(although zsh is *fully* backwards-compatible with bash) can lead to
unexpected results; this is because, contrary to intuition, they are
not parsed by the sha-bang header, but the current shell (equivalent
of trying to source a python file on ksh).
